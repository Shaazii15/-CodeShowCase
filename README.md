# -CodeShowCase

Welcome to the Code ShowCase – a beginner-friendly repository demonstrating code examples across multiple programming languages.

## 🚀 Purpose
This project is designed to:
- Help new coders explore and run code in languages like Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, and more.
- Provide a quick reference for comparing syntax across languages.
- Serve as a learning tool for developers and educators.

## 📂 What's Inside?
Each folder contains:
- A simple code example (e.g., "Hello, World!" or similar).
- Clear setup instructions.
- Steps to run the code.

## 💡 Why Use This?
- Learn the basics of various programming languages.
- Compare language syntax in one place.
- Experiment with new languages easily.
